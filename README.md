## Building and running the programm

### Linux

There are two ways to build the program on Linux systems.
- Using the system package manager to install all dependencies (tested: apt on Ubuntu, pacman on Arch Linux).
- Using [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) to install all dependencies.

In the project root directory, two scripts `build-linux.sh` and `build-linux-vcpkg.sh` can be found. The former uses the
system package manager to install all dependencies, while the latter uses vcpkg. The build scripts will also launch the
program after successfully building it. If you wish to build the program manually, instructions can be found in the
directory `docs/compilation`.

Below, more information concerning different Linux distributions tested can be found.

#### Arch Linux

Arch Linux and its derivative Manjaro are fully supported using both build modes (package manager and vcpkg).

The Vulkan SDK (which is an optional dependency for different advanced rendering modes) will be automatically installed
using the package manager `pacman` when using the scripts.

#### Ubuntu 18.04 & 20.04

Ubuntu 20.04 is fully supported.

The Vulkan SDK will be automatically installed using the official PPA.

Please note that Ubuntu 18.04 is only partially supported. It ships an old version of CMake, which causes the build
process using vcpkg to fail if not updating CMake manually beforehand. Also, an old version of GLEW in the package
sources causes the Vulkan support in sgl to be disabled regardless of whether the Vulkan SDK is installed if the system
packages are used.

#### Other Linux Distributions

If you are using a different Linux distribution and face difficulties when building the program, please feel free to
open a [bug report](https://github.com/chrismile/CloudRendering/issues).


### Windows

There are two ways to build the program on Windows.
- Using [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) to install all dependencies. The program can then be compiled using
  [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/).
- Using [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) to install all dependencies and compile the program using MinGW.

In the project folder, a script called `build-windows.bat` can be found automating this build process using vcpkg and
Visual Studio. It is recommended to run the script using the `Developer PowerShell for VS 2022` (or VS 2019 depending on
your Visual Studio version). The build script will also launch the program after successfully building it.
Building the program is regularly tested on Windows 10 and 11 with Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 and 2022.

Please note that the [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home#windows) needs to be installed before starting the
build process.

A script `build-windows-msys2.bat` is also available to build the program using MSYS2/MinGW alternatively to using
Microsoft Visual Studio.

If you wish to build the program manually using Visual Studio and vcpkg, or using MSYS2, instructions can be found in
the directory `docs/compilation`.


### macOS

Unfortunately, macOS is currently not supported due to a lack of devices to test this program on.
MoltenVK, a Vulkan wrapper based on Apple's Metal API, might theoretically be able to run this program with only minor
modifications.


### Unit Tests

Unit tests using the [GoogleTest framework](https://github.com/google/googletest) can be built by passing the argument
`-DUSE_GTEST=On` to CMake.
These unit tests can also be run using software rendering via [SwiftShader](https://github.com/google/swiftshader).


### PyTorch Module (Work in Progress)

A [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) module can be built by passing `-DBUILD_PYTORCH_MODULE=On` to CMake.

It provides the function `initialize`, `cleanup` and `render_frame` and works both with CPU tensors and CUDA tensors.
To use this module, the dependency sgl must have been built using CUDA interoperability support (this should happen
automatically when CUDA is detected on the system).

The path to where the module should be installed can be specified using `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/dir`.
If TorchLib does not lie on a standard path, the directory where the CMake config files of TorchLib lie must be
specified using, e.g.:

```
-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=~/miniconda3/envs/cloud_rendering/lib/python3.8/site-packages/torch/share/cmake
```


Additionally, if using the module on Linux, PyTorch must have been build using the C++11 ABI.
This is not the case for pre-built PyTorch packages as of 2022-02-14.
The command `python -c "import torch; print(torch._C._GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI)"` can be used to check whether PyTorch was
built using the C++11 ABI.

If necessary, PyTorch can be built manually using the commands below (assuming the CUDA Toolkit version 11.5 and
[Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) are installed on the system).

```shell
sudo apt install g++ git libgflags-dev libgoogle-glog-dev libopenmpi-dev protobuf-compiler python3 python3-pip \
python3-setuptools python3-yaml wget intel-mkl

. "$HOME/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh"
conda create --name cloud_rendering python=3.8
conda activate cloud_rendering

conda install numpy ninja pyyaml mkl mkl-include setuptools cmake cffi typing
conda install -c pytorch magma-cuda115

git clone --recursive https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch
cd pytorch
export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=${CONDA_PREFIX:-"$(dirname $(which conda))/../"}
export TORCH_CXX_FLAGS="-D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=1"
export USE_MKLDNN=1
export USE_VULKAN=1
python setup.py install
```

It is planned to also add support for the PyTorch Vulkan backend once the PyTorch Vulkan code base has sufficiently
matured. As of 2022-02-14, there are still some problems building PyTorch with Vulkan support on x86_64 Linux.


## How to add new data sets

Under `Data/CloudDataSets/datasets.json`, loadable data sets can be specified. Additionally, the user can also open
arbitrary data sets using a file explorer via "File > Open Dataset..." (or using Ctrl+O).

Below, an example for a `Data/CloudDataSets/datasets.json` file can be found.

```json
{
    "datasets": [
        { "name" : "Sphere (64x64x64)", "filename": "sphere_64x64x64.xyz" },
        { "name" : "Bunny", "filename": "bunny.nvdb" }
    ]
}
```

These files then appear with their specified name in the menu "File > Datasets". All paths must be specified relative to
the folder `Data/CloudDataSets/` (unless they are global, like `C:/path/file.dat` or `/path/file.dat`).

Supported formats currently are:
- .xyz files, which consist of a header of 3x float (grid size sx, sy, sz) and 3x double (voxel size vx, vy, vz)
  followed by sx * sy * sz floating point values storing the density values stored in the dense Cartesian grid.
- .nvdb files using the [NanoVDB](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openvdb/tree/master/nanovdb/nanovdb)
  format, which stores sparse voxel grids.
